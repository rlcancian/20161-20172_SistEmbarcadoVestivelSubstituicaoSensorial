In order for the Altera Monitor Program to properly access the
development board via the JTAG interface, the USB-Blaster cable
needs to be properly configured on the system.

1. Give non-root users access to the USB-Blaster device. The
   following is given for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), but it
   should work on other Linux systems as well.

   * RHEL 4 and below:

     a. Add these lines to /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap:

        #
        # Altera USB-Blaster
        #
        usbblaster 0x03 0x09fb 0x6001 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0
        usbblaster 0x03 0x09fb 0x6002 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0
        usbblaster 0x03 0x09fb 0x6003 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0

     b. Create a file named /etc/hotplug/usb/usbblaster with the following contents:

        #!/bin/sh
        # USB-Blaster hotplug script
        # Allow any user to access the cable
        chmod 666 $DEVICE

     c. Make the file executable:
        chmod +x /etc/hotplug/usb/usbblaster

   * RHEL 5 and above (has been tested to work with Ubuntu 12.04 as well):

     Add the following lines to the /etc/udev/rules.d/51-usbblaster.rules file:

     # USB-Blaster
     BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="09fb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", MODE="0666", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'K=%k; K=$${K#usbdev}; printf /proc/bus/usb/%%03i/%%03i$${K%%%%.*} $${K#*.}'", RUN+="/bin/chmod 0666 %c"

2. Configure jtagd (the JTAG Daemon):

   a. Create the directory /etc/jtagd if it does not already exist

   b. Copy and rename the file $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/linux/pgm_parts.txt to /etc/jtagd/jtagd.pgm_parts
      (Where $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR is the Quartus II installation directory)
      NOTE: In this step, the file is renamed from "pgm_parts.txt" to "jtagd.pgm_parts".

   c. Create a blank file named ~/.jtag.conf (in your home directory)

3. Make sure jtagd is run with admin privileges:

   Add the following line to /etc/rc.local:

   $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin/jtagd

   (Where $QUARTUS_ROOTDIR is the Quartus II installation directory)
   The line must be added before the 'exit 0' line.

4. Restart your machine
